# Hotel-Booking-EDA
This project aims to analyze three years of hotel booking data to uncover patterns and insights related to booking cancellations . By examining factors such as booking month, prices, lead time, and geographical origin, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of booking behaviors and trends.


Data Overview
The dataset represents three years of hotel bookings, primarily from Europe, with Portugal being the main source of bookings. The hotels are categorized into two types: Resorts and City Hotels.

Key Findings
Busiest Month: August is the busiest month for bookings, which coincides with higher prices.
December Bookings: Despite fewer bookings in December, prices remain relatively high, suggesting a unique demand pattern that warrants further investigation.

Booking Cancellations:
Peak Cancellation Months: Most cancellations occur in May and June.
Geographical Insights: Cancellations are predominantly from Portugal.
Lead Time: Bookings with longer lead times tend to have higher cancellation rates.

Repeat Guests:
The majority of guests are first-time visitors, indicating a potential area for improving customer retention and loyalty programs.


Analysis Approach
Univariate Analysis: Examined individual features such as booking month, prices, and lead time to understand their distributions and trends.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigated relationships between pairs of features, such as lead time and cancellation rates, to identify significant patterns.
Geographical Analysis: Analyzed the geographical origin of bookings to understand regional behaviors and trends.
